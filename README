# Freakin'!

Android FRN client for radio amateur repeater networks.

This application allows users to connect to FRN networks/servers
to transmit and receive in FRN-based hotspot/repeater networks.
Contains an audiophile's kit (a.k.a compressor) for those who does not
think that ham radios is as basic speech transmission method as it can get.

WARNING: the FRN protocol IS NOT ENCRYPTED. This means that your password is transmitted in clear text.
DO NOT connect to your FRN server using public wifi, or pirates will hold a burping/swearing contest all over it.


Does the app require root permissions?
    No. Why it should?
Can it interact with other apps?
    Not for now. Maybe some radio-related apps in future.
How easy is it to use?
    Requires basic amateur radio knowledge.

=====================
This program is redistributed under GNU GPL v3 and contains parts of other software under
open source licenses.

=====================
WARNING. If you connect to actual repeater network you need a valid amateur radio.
Check your country's laws, because some countries restrict remote operations of
amateur radio.

====================
PERMISSIONS:
This software uses following permissions:
- record and play audio - to receive/transmit audio.
- wakelock - to more efficiently drain your battery when you forgot to turn the app off (e.g. to work continuously)
- internet - to leak your spots to wsprnet.org when you don't want to

Most of this permissions are requested only when you turn features that require them in the settings, and should
not be required for app to work without that features.


===================
CRASHES & BUGZ

The app now has a error reporting library included. So you can send a bug report.
There is also a native (C++) crash reporter that has no e-mail reporting, so files from
/sdcard/Android/files/.../crashes (exact folder on your device may vary) has to be sent
manually.

==================
TRANSLATE
If you want to translate this app to your language, you need to
find a file called strings.xml in the project source code,
open it in any text editor that supports UTF-8 and modify it
while following XML markup language. If your language is weirder than
mine, you need to provide additional details on what I should do with
numerals etc. But it may take a long time to implement all this, so
it's better if you prepare a separate file that will work somehow without
modifying large portions of code.

==================
APPLE JAM
There is NO Iphone(r)Â©(tm) version planned. I do not have any Apple inc.
devices to code/test/debug on, I am unfamiliar with their systems.

EMOTIONAL SUPPORT
We, HAMs need more skilled coders. So, if you want to toss a coin, go and
pay someone who will create and release a new cool opensource app like this one.
(I mean REALLY cool, not another logbook).
If you still want to donate, you have to do this in Bitcoin,
