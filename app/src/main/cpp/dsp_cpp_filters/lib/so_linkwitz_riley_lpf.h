* fc , corner frequency (-6 dB)
* Second-order Linkwitz/Riley LPFs are designed to have an attenuation of -6 dB
* at the corner frequency rather than the standard -3 dB When these
* filters are placed in parallel with the same cutoff frequency, their outputs sum exactly and
* the resulting response is flat. They are often used in crossovers.
